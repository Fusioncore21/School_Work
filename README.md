# School_Work
This is simply a repository for me to store all of my programming I do at school and at home. It isn't anything complicated. If anyone sees this repo and wants to help, feel free to make a pull request. I'm not the best python programmer and any help would be awesome.

Furthermore, I am getting used with git and GitHub, but I have my laptop and my PC synced with this repo, so I can make changes anywhere. 

## Project 1: Computer Shop System (A-level Yr 12 transition work)
Overview: This project's aim is to create a simple shop system, where a user can buy a computer. It also has an admin board to update and check recent orders (Orders made on the same day)

### Objectives:

1. Create a working shop system from a table of prices of computer components. Display them in a selectable fashion. When the components have been selected, assign a timestamp and order ID to a file for future reference.
2. Create an Admin board, protected by a simple password. This admin board is able to change the stock value of each component, as well as check on the day's orders.
