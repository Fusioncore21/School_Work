# School_Work
This is simply a repository for me to store all of my programming I do at school and at home. It isn't anything complicated. If anyone sees this repo and wants to help, feel free to make a pull request. I'm not the best python programmer and any help would be awesome.

Furthermore, I am getting used with git and GitHub, but I have my laptop and my PC synced with this repo, so I can make changes anywhere. 

Thanks for reading!
